Three fair coins are tossed. 

* If the first head occurs on the first toss, you score 1 point. 

* If the first head occurs on toss 2 or on toss 3, you score 2 or 3 points, respectively.

* If no heads appear, you lose 1 point (that is score -1 point). 

*What is the probability that **fewer than three heads** will occur and you will **score 1 or less?***
