Monte Carlo simulation is especially useful for estimating the probability of a phenomena
when no closed-form expression for the probability value exists, 
or when it does exist but it is actually computationally cheaper to get a satisfactory first approximation through simulation.
            
Here we use it to verify a theoretically calculated value with empirical simulation.
